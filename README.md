# Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language Processing

It's my master's thesis. The original plan: 
+ Gather available information about RL.
+ Implement RL methods.
+ Find ways in which RL algorithms and NLP models can interact.
+ Make a project that demonstrates the capabilities of the module.
I will describe more details later.
